# Thermodynamic-Reactivity-Study-of-Alcohol-Air-Mixtures-with-Water
This project investigates the combustion characteristics and thermodynamic reactivity of light alcohol fuel-air mixtures, including the impact of water as a mitigating agent. The study uses experimental data and theoretical analysis to provide insights into safe and efficient fuel utilization in various combustion systems.
Key Highlights
Focus of Study:

Explores the influence of water addition (10-60% by volume) on the combustion parameters of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and iso-propanol.
Examines explosion pressure, rate of pressure rise, and explosion delay time in closed vessel conditions.
Studies conducted at initial conditions: 323.15 K temperature and 1 bar pressure.
Experimental Setup:

A 20L combustion testing vessel equipped with:
Pressure and temperature measurement systems.
Ignition system for controlled explosions.
Mixing devices to ensure homogeneity of the fuel-air mixture.
Main Findings:

Water addition mitigates explosion intensity and delays ignition, particularly beneficial for safety in industrial settings.
Methanol-water mixtures exhibit high reactivity at low water contents, but reactivity decreases with increased water addition.
Ethanol and n-propanol show unique trends in explosion pressure and reaction delay, influenced by equivalence ratios and water content.
Iso-propanol demonstrates complex behavior with water addition, highlighting the need for detailed kinetic studies.
Applications:

Insights for safer handling and combustion of alcohol fuels.
Guidance for blending alcohols with conventional fuels in engines and turbines.
Framework for optimizing combustion in energy and automotive industries.
